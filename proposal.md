# Graphics Final Project Proposal
Authors: Sidney Wijngaarde and Pat Xu

## Overview
We want to build a procedurally generated world scene with two major components:

### World Generation
- using controlled variation as discussed in class, generate a world mesh to represent the large-scale features of the terrain

### Texturing and Modeling
- using a set of simple rules (e.g. elevation, gradient), texture and add models to the world
- textures include color, bump mapping
- modeling includes trees, water

These two components reflect a general division of labor within the team.

## Milestones
Each step in our timeline is relatively general and provides plenty of room for exploration and extension
1. plain world mesh
1. add variation to the mesh via noise methods
1. partition mesh into specific regions
1. bump map and color mesh
1. add models to mesh
